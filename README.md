# 👋 Hey, I'm Yash (aka Lazyybummm)

> Relentlessly building, learning, and shipping.

I'm a self-driven full-stack developer (MERN) obsessed with turning ideas into polished, monetizable products. I live for clean code, fast feedback loops, and pushing boundaries with AI and real-time systems. My focus is deep — not wide — and I love turning concepts into working tools with real impact.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- ⚡ Bud-Ai — all-in-one productivity assistant (summarizer, translator, AI chat)
- 🧠 Electron + Tesseract desktop overlay for real-time screen intelligence
- 🔧 Building a custom component library with React + Tailwind + Framer Motion
- 💼 Portfolio projects aimed at monetization & scalability

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Recoil
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Tools**: Git, MongoDB (sometimes), Tesseract OCR, Electron, GPT/Cohere APIs

### 🎯 Philosophy
- Code like a craftsman. Think like a product founder.
- Learn obsessively. Ship ruthlessly.
- Automate the boring. Monetize the smart.
